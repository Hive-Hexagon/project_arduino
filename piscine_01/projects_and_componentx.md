# Projects and components
The Arduino Piscine projects are designed to increase in complexity. Since the hardware components will be reused for each project, students will be instructed to record videos of their working project in action. The videos will be used for final evaluations.

The focus here is on learning to work with the arduino in a short weekend, we will not have strict norm requirements for the project. Students only need to demonstrate a working  product with a recording of each project.

The projects will be split into a fundamental and advanced sections. Fundamental projects will introduce students to the basics of working with an Arduino, and controlling inputs and outputs. From there, students will have the option to create anything they want, or if they don't know what to make, can continue to follow a set of advanced projects.

## Project List

### Foundation
1. Blink the ‘L’ LED light on the Arduino board.  
    a. The Hello World of an Arduino! Figure out how to blink the little L light on the Arduino board.  
	b. Hardware:  
		* Arduino & USB cable
2. Blink a single LED light:  
	a. Upgrade the Hello World. Let’s light up a single external LED light!  
	b. Hardware:  
		* 1 LED
		* 1 220 Ω resistor
		* 1 wire
		* Arduino & USB cable
3. Create a blinking LED Wave:
	a. Let’s light up some LEDs! You will need to light up 5 LEDs in a row, in a wave light pattern. Like the TV show car KITT from knight rider.
	b. Hardware:
		* 5 LEDs
		* 5 560 Ω resistors
		* One breadboard
		* Bunch of connecting wires
		* Arduino & USB cable
4. Demonstrate a Pulse-width modulation (PWM):
	a. Create a “breathing effect” on light 3 from the project above.
	b. Hardware:
		* Same as 3.
