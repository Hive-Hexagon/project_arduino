# Projects and components
During ‘Piscine’ Arduino Jam, the projects are designed to increase in complexity. Since the hardware components will need to be reused for each project, students will be instructed to record videos of their project working. The videos will be used for final evaluations.

The focus here is on learning to work with the arduino in a short weekend, we will not have strict norm requirements for the project. Students only need to demonstrate a working  product with a recording of each project.
